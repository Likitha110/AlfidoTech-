**Iris Flower Classification**

**Description:**

This project focuses on the classification of Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used for this classification task is the Iris Flower Dataset, which contains 150 samples with equal distribution among the three species.

**Data Preprocessing:**

The initial step involves importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset. Data preprocessing steps include renaming the species labels, encoding them numerically, and checking for any missing values, which are found to be absent. Visualizations such as scatter plots and pair plots are utilized to explore the relationships between different features and species.

**Model Selection:**

Several classification models are trained and evaluated using the preprocessed data. The models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier. For each model, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Trained various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

**Dependencies:**

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn


**Movie Rating Prediction**

This project aims to predict movie ratings based on user demographics and movie attributes. The dataset used for this prediction contains information about movies, ratings given by users, and user demographics. We utilize machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors for prediction.

**Dataset Description**

**The dataset consists of the following files:**

**movies.dat**: Contains information about movies including MovieID, MovieName, and Genres.

|**ratings.dat:** Provides user ratings for movies including ID, MovieID, Ratings, and Timestamp.

**users.dat:** Contains user demographic information including UserID, Gender, Age, category, and Zip-code.


**Model Training**

**Logistic Regression:** To predict movie ratings based on user demographics.
**K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier:** To classify movies based on user attributes.

**Model Evaluation**

We evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix to assess their performance in predicting movie ratings.

**Conclusion**

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of around 33.46%, while the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier is trained to classify movies based on user attributes.

**Titanic Survival Prediction**

**Description:**

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various classification algorithms. The dataset utilized includes information such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and embarkation port.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Data preprocessing steps were implemented to handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.
The Pandas library was utilized for data manipulation, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Exploratory data analysis techniques, including visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, were employed to gain insights into the dataset.
Visualizations such as count plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps were utilized to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
Model Building:

Three classification algorithms were implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function.
Each model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Results**:

The models achieved an accuracy of approximately 61% on the test set, indicating moderate predictive performance.
Confusion matrices were utilized to visualize the models' performance in predicting survival outcomes, highlighting areas of correct and incorrect predictions.
This project serves as an illustrative example of applying machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict outcomes, with a specific focus on survival prediction in the context of the Titanic disaster.
